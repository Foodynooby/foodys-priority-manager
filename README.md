# foody's priority manager
hi :3 this is a lightweight python script that automatically sets discord task manager priority to low every 5 seconds because it tanks performance and for some reason anytime you do Anything it resets priority back to high

for me this entirely got rid of lag spikes playing GD so idk i recommend this if youre having performance issues!!!

you can also optionally use the config.exe to customize what apps you want at what priority level and toggle on auto-start!!!
###### notes: 
###### - some apps (eg. firefox) are unable to be changed idrk why
###### - using the "real time" option can lead to system instability so use that at your own risk (should be fine though!)
by default it just has discord on low and gd on high

### how 2 use
1. download the latest release from the releases page
2. extract the .zip file
3. (optional) run foodypriority_config.exe to:
- add or remove apps
- set their CPU priority
- change scan interval
- toggle on/off autostart
4. run foodypriority.exe to start the background process!! ;3c
###### (if autostart is enabled, the background process will launch at system startup automatically)
