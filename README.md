# heaven's priority manager
hi :3 this is a lightweight python script that automatically sets discord task manager priority to low every 5 seconds because it tanks performance and for some reason anytime you do Anything it resets priority back to high

you can edit the code to be any program you want i guess but by default it sets discord to "idle" (low) and geometry dash to high. theres not really a way to close it outside of task manager yet though... 

for me this entirely got rid of lag spikes playing GD so idk i recommend this if youre having performance issues!!!
