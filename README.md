# foody's priority manager
## SCROLL ↓↓↓ FOR HOW TO INSTALL!!!

hi :3 this is a lightweight python script that automatically sets Discord task manager priority to low every 5 seconds because it tanks performance and for some reason anytime you do Anything it resets priority back to high

for me this entirely got rid of lag spikes playing GD so idk i recommend this if youre having performance issues!!!

you can also optionally use the config file to customize what apps you want at what priority level and toggle on auto-start :)
###### notes: 
###### - some apps (eg. Firefox) are unable to be changed idrk why
###### - using the "real time" option can supposedly lead to system instability so use that at your own risk but it should be fine. do note this does require main app to be ran as admin.
###### - windows defender will flag this 

## how 2 use/install
1. download the latest release from **Releases** over to the right
2. extract the .zip file (i recommend WinRAR or 7-Zip)
3. (optional but recommended) run foodypriorityconfig.exe to:
- set their processing priority
- change scan interval
- toggle on/off autostart
- add or remove apps (find the exact names in the details section of task manager)
4. run foodypriority.exe to start the background process!! ;3c
  (windows defender will say its unrecognized because i need to pay money to get it licensed to remove that popup so just click run anyways)
###### (if autostart is enabled, the background process will launch at system startup automatically)
