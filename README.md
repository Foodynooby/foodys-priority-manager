# heaven's priority manager
lightweight python script that automatically sets discord task manager priority to low because it tanks performance and for some reason anytime you do Anything it resets priority back to high

you can edit the code to be any program you want i guess but by default it sets discord to "idle" (low) and geometry dash to high. theres not really a way to close it outside of task manager yet though... 

for me this entirely got rid of lag spikes playing GD so idk i recommend this if youre having performance issues!!!
